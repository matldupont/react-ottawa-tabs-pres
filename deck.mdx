"The biggest misconception about accessibility is that by adding it you're doing somebody a favor. You're not, you're doing your job." ~ james williamson

---

## ARIA

A standard for Accessible Rich Internet Applications

---

## UI Interactions

Basically just showing and hiding stuff

Popup menus, tooltips, disclosure widgets, accordions...

---

## Tabbed Interfaces

---

### A Story of Progressive Enhancement

---

Start with semantic HTML that works with standard browser behaviour.

Enhancing with JS might not even be necessary.

---

### Tabbed Interfaces on the web

Maybe a Table of Contents with some Sections?

---

- Table of contents -> tab list
- Same-page links -> tabs
- Sections -> tab panels

---

Unfolded, this would be structurally sound as an HTML document for a user to easily navigate.

... but not what really what we're after

---

section:not(:target) { display: none; }

Hides the content from screen readers. This gives a similar experience to all users.

---

## PROBLEM!

If you link to sub sections, the parent wouldn't be the target and made visible on click.

Enter some hefty JS.

---

## Let's remember

---

All this to show how you MIGHT create a tabbed interface on the web.

---

A table of contents isn't typically expected to show or hide elements.

---

_Consistency and expected behaviour are important and should be maintained for usability._

---

## True Tabbed Interfaces on the web

---

Same-page links have an edge in terms of simple and standard browser behaviours.

Tabbed interfaces are a pattern borrowed from desktop applications.

---

The fact that they aren't native to the web should drive home the importance of _careful and deliberate design and \*ARIA semantics_

---

## The key difference

Expected keyboard behaviour.

ARIA semantics further complements the structure in order to alert screen reader users to the keyboard uses that are now expected.

---

### ARIA Roles

- tablist -> doesn't delegate to children
- tab
- tabpanel
- \*presentation -> removes semantic meaning

---

### More ARIA Stuff

- aria-label
- aria-labelledby links back to the link id for screen readers
- aria-selected

---

## Keyboard Interactions and ARIA Authoring Practices

---

1. Links move the user to the assciated content, but clicking a tab simply shows the content visually.

Great for sighted users hoping to skim through the tabs quickly.

\*You have to tab through all the tabs to get to the content

---

2. Solved by implementing functionality for the arrow keys to move between tabs and the tab key to enter the visible content that exists below.

Tab is not for tabs... weird.

---

3.  Shift + Tab _should_ send them back to the selected tab with all others set to tabindex="-1"

---

4. Authoring Practices also mention loop-around functionality with arrow keys

---

DEMO TIME!

---

## PROBLEM!

This is all helpful, but only if the user know how the interactions work as well as the keys to use.

Not necessarily nor likely the case, even with blind, tech savvy users.

---

## PROBLEM!

You can only tab into a panel that has interactive content.

Fine for sighted users as they can see the content by skimming through the tabs as mentioned about.

Screen reader users have to use additional screen reader functionality to get through each of the inactive tabs.

---

tabindex="0" on the tabpanels can make them focusable so the user can enter the panel from there.

---

## PROBLEM!

Voiceover on macOS has issues with nested focusable elements.

Tabbing would just move past the content inside the focusable panel to the next interactive element outside the panel.

---

This also goes against the general rule to avoid making non-interactive elements focusable.

It implies to the user that they should expect to interact with it.

---

aria-controls="panel-id" on the tab gives the ability to skip to the panel

... but online in JAWS software. Not others.

---

## WHAT A MESS!

Let's be realistic.

---

## Conclusion

Do user testing

---

The standard practices might fail your users.

So, do user testing.

---

People might perceive and understand UI patterns in different ways.

Therefore, try user testing.

---

You might have to adjust things to meet your users' needs

... based on user testing.
